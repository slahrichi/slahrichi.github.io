excerpt: In this work, we investigate the problem of real-time design of electromagnetic (EM) metamaterials to achieve custom scattering properties; a type of inverse modeling problem. To address this problem, we investigate a class of DNN-based models that are specially designed to address inverse problems, termed deep inverse models (DIMs). DIMs have recently shown tremendous promise for solving material design problems, however, relatively less work has been done for high-dimensional problems, such as near-field design. In this work, we performed 1500 simulations of a metasurface with a 3x3 array of meta-atom pillars, where we independently and randomly-varied the radii of each pillar and recorded the resulting electric near-field values. We then used this dataset to train and evaluate several data-driven inverse models, including several variations of a recently-successful DIM, termed the Tandem. Our results indicate that the Tandem is capable of making relatively accurate design predictions in this challenging high-dimensional settings, and doing so in real-time (e.g., roughly 4ms). We find that the choice of model architecture significantly impacts the accuracy of the inverse model, and even higher accuracy can be achieved with further improvements to the Tandemâ€™s design.

Optical metasurfaces, used in applications such as signature management and wavefront sculpting, are increasingly leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) for inverse design. The objective is to significantly accelerate the discovery of innovative solutions, moving beyond traditional, slow, and inefficient simulation-based methods or reliance on human intuition. In this article, various AI-driven approaches are examined for learning a robust forward prediction emulator, a key step in inverse design. Despite their potential, challenges remain, including issues with accuracy, generalization, and the need for unrealistic amounts of data. The networks are compared and contrasted, ranging from direct models that map design parameters to waves to sequence-based approaches that aim to learn incremental wave propagation. Using a dataset generated in MEEP, best practices are sought regarding network architecture, optimization, penalization, evaluation criteria, and experimental design. Ultimately, these details and insights are intended to enhance research reproducibility, address the practical implementation of these networks, and offer recommendations for future AI solutions.
